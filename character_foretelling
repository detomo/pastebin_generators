$history
Before you were born
When you were born
When you were a young child
When a loved one died
When your beloved pet died
When you came of age
When you were named
A generation ago
When a sibling was born
When your family was cursed
When you left home
When you spoke your first word
When you were lost as a child
When your parents first met
During a storm
At a great festival
When you took your first steps
During an eclipse of the sun
During a full moon
